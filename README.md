# Kahve Engine
This is my own implementation of the [Kohi Engine](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), written by Travis Vroman, following his [game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj). The name "Kahve" is Turkish for coffee, which makes sense since the original engine is named "Kohi (コーヒー)", which is Japanese for coffee.
